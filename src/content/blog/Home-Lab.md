## Overview

**Real-World Attack Simulations:** Understanding the power of penetration testing as I replicate authentic attack vectors. Understand vulnerabilities and the importance of proactive defense.

**Vulnerability Exploration:** Delve into vulnerabilities, from software bugs to misconfigurations. Grasp their potential impact on security posture.

**Toolbox Exploration:** Discover industry-standard tools and frameworks. Gain insights into their usage, effectiveness, and how they bolster security.

**Defense Strategies:** It’s not just about attacks; robust defense matters. Explore the implementation of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, SIEM and more.

**Shared Knowledge:** Find invaluable resources, courses, and reading materials that fuel my growth in cyber security as I take certifications.

**Malware Analysis:** With a controlled environment, I dissect and analyze malicious software to understand its behavior, origins, and potential impact.

## Network and Servers

Here’s a list of the components that form the backbone of my home lab:
-   **Server Host:** Optiplex 7040 SFF, i5-6500, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Hostname: UKHOST01, OS: Proxmox
