# A Traceable Dining Cryptographers Protocol — Simplified

## Introduction

The Dining Cryptographers Protocol (DCP) is a classic problem that ensures anonymity: when a group of cryptographers pays for dinner, the others should not be able to tell **who** paid, only **whether** someone did.

In this version, we extend DCP with **traceability** and **public channels only**, while still protecting anonymity.

---

## Requirements

1. All secret messages must be communicated over **public channels**.
2. Announcements must be **traceable and verifiable**, while preserving anonymity.

---

## Cryptographic Ingredients

Each cryptographer (e.g., Wallace, Gromit, Feathers McGraw) prepares:

- A digital signature key pair: `(KprX, KpbX)`
- Performs a **public Diffie-Hellman exchange** with neighbors to get shared secret bits.
- Uses signatures to make announcements **verifiable**.

---

## Step-by-Step Protocol (3 Participants)

Let’s assume we have **Wallace**, **Gromit**, and **Feathers McGraw** sitting in a circle.

### 1. Key Setup

Each cryptographer:
- Generates `(KprX, KpbX)`
- Publishes `KpbX` publicly

### 2. Derive Shared Bits

Using a Diffie-Hellman exchange **over public channels**, each pair (Wallace–Gromit, Gromit–Feathers McGraw, Feathers McGraw–Wallace) agrees on a **shared secret bit** by hashing their shared key.

- Wallace gets: `bAB` and `bCA`
- Gromit gets: `bBC` and `bAB`
- Feathers McGraw gets: `bCA` and `bBC`

### 3. Each Agent Picks a Message Bit

- `mX = 1` if paying, otherwise `0`

Let’s assume:
- Wallace is the payer → `mA = 1`
- Gromit and Feathers McGraw are not → `mB = mC = 0`

### 4. Calculate Announcement

Each agent calculates:

```
aX = left_bit ⊕ right_bit ⊕ mX
```

- Wallace: `aW = bCA ⊕ bAB ⊕ 1`
- Gromit: `aG = bAB ⊕ bBC ⊕ 0`
- Feathers McGraw: `aF = bBC ⊕ bCA ⊕ 0`

### 5. Sign and Announce

Each agent signs their announcement:

```
σX = {|aX|}KprX
```

They publish: `(aX, σX)`

### 6. Final XOR

All announcements are XORed:

```
A = aW ⊕ aG ⊕ aF
```

- If `A = 0`, then **no one paid**
- If `A = 1`, then **exactly one person paid**

No one knows **who**, because shared bits obscure the `mX`.

## Summary of Benefits

| Feature        | How it's Achieved                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Secrecy        | Shared bits derived securely using DH + Hash       |
| Verifiability  | Digital signatures used for announcements          |
| Anonymity      | XORing shared bits hides who paid                  |
| Traceability   | Public keys validate origin of each announcement   |
| Public-only    | All messages use open/public communication         |

## Conclusion

This version of the Dining Cryptographers Protocol meets modern cryptographic expectations:
- Works over **public channels**
- Allows **verifiable attribution**
- Maintains the **core anonymity guarantee**

It shows how classic privacy protocols can evolve with practical cryptographic tools.
